# My Personal Project: "Mom & Pop's"

## What is "Mom & Pop's"?

Mom & Pop's is a multi-functional recipe and ingredient manager that allows people to
consolidate all of their recipes in one place. This app seeks to answer the question
**"What am I going to make tonight."**

## Who will use it?

This application will be used by:
- Students who are no longer living with their parents.
- Busy professionals with "no time" to cook.
- Elderly folk who have begun to forget their recipes.
- People who would like to preserve recipes that have been passed down generations.

As students move out, they will no longer be able to eat food made by their *'mom and pop's'*.
Consequently, this recipe manager will allow students to follow family recipes
and cook their favourite meals away from home. **In the absence of mom and dad,
the app "Mom & Pop's" will help people feed themselves tasty and healthy homecooked meals.**

## Why is this project of interest to me?

From a young age, my mom began teaching me how to cook and bake. I didn't know it then,
but I now recognize that she was teaching me an invaluable skill. As a student living away
from home, I enjoy cooking for myself and emulating my mom's recipes. However, I sometimes
find that I cannot remember certain ingredients that go into making her food. Furthermore, living alone has made me
realize that it is
difficult to manage an inventory of food and keep track of when food expires. **After experiencing
these problems, I am interested in creating an app that may solve them.**
